        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Vincent_(painter)"><b>George Vincent</b></a>
        (baptised 27 June 1796 – c. 1832) was an <span>English</span> landscape artist who produced
        watercolours, etchings and oil paintings. He is considered by art historians to be one of the more
        talented of the Norwich School of painters, a group of artists connected by location and personal
        and professional relationships, who were mainly inspired by the Norfolk countryside. Vincent's work
        nded on the Dutch school of landscape painting as well as the style of John Crome, also of the
        Norwich School.

        After 1831, Vincent disappeared. He was never found, despite attempts by his family to locate him,
        and his whereabouts after this date remain uncertain. His death may have occurred before April 1832,
        perhaps in Bath, Somerset. His picture Greenwich Hospital from the River, which was shown in London
        three decades after his death, caused renewed interest in his paintings and helped to establish
        his reputation as a leading member of the Norwich School. The art historian Herbert Minton
        Cundall wrote in the 1920s that had Vincent "not given way to intemperate habits he would probably
        have ranked amongst the foremost of British landscape painters".
